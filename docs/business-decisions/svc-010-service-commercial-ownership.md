# SVC-010: Service Commercial Ownership

- **Decision ID:** SVC-010
- **Workbook Decision ID:** DEC-SVC-010
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2026-07-12T08:33:47.768Z
- **Decision owner:** Derek / Commercial / Service owners
- **Related domains:** Service, Configuration

## Context

Business discovery asked: **Who owns menus, packages, pricing and effective dates for each service arrangement?**

Before approval, the recorded evidence stated: “Commercial and catalogue ownership was repeatedly not yet confirmed.” The question was recorded as a refinement decision with low repository confidence before approval.

## Decision

Sam the culinary director at top level, delegated to Brian, the project chef.

## Business rationale

FIKA needed one authoritative answer to the ambiguity recorded in [docs/domain-discovery/service-domain-discovery.md](../domain-discovery/service-domain-discovery.md), specifically the section `G. Client and commercial relationships`. Without a canonical decision, later documents or applications could interpret this subject differently.

The approved decision establishes a shared business rule. The alternative—leaving the matter implicit or allowing each implementation to decide independently—was rejected because it would recreate competing business meaning. Historical and supporting material remains evidence, but it cannot override this decision.

## Positive consequences

- FIKA now has a stable, human-approved rule for this aspect of Service.
- It provides stable business meaning for later BDR, schema and architecture work.
- Stage 5 schemas and Stage 6 architecture can trace their treatment of this subject to one canonical source.
- Application and provider behaviour cannot silently redefine the decision.

## Trade-offs

- The decision constrains local interpretation where consistency is required.
- Any future change must preserve history and use a superseding or amended BDR rather than silently editing downstream documents.
- The decision deliberately leaves technology, storage and API design to later stages.

## Implementation implications

Service models must preserve the approved distinctions among Service Arrangement, Recurring Schedule, Service Occurrence, Booking and related domains.

This BDR does not select a database, API, provider, application design or deployment approach.

## Evidence

- [FIKA Business Knowledge Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195jMni3vG5fX5hfAUFARc-vC2ifO8AI8r0r4xQUeoxk/edit) — **Canonical**; DEC-SVC-010, sourced from `Questions!44`.
- [docs/domain-discovery/service-domain-discovery.md](../domain-discovery/service-domain-discovery.md) — **Supporting**; `G. Client and commercial relationships`.
- [Platform principles](../platform-principles.md) — **Canonical**; business meaning, authority, configuration and gradual-migration principles.
- [Business-discovery process](../platform-methodology/business-discovery-process.md) — **Canonical methodology**; approval, exact wording, dependency and history rules.

## Supersedes / Superseded by

- **Supersedes:** None
- **Superseded by:** None

## Future considerations

There are no open discovery questions for this decision. During BDR review, evidence and explanatory text should be checked without altering the Decision section. Later schema, architecture and implementation work must resolve technical detail while preserving this approved business meaning.
